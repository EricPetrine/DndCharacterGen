<h1> IST 411 project proposal <br>
Eric Petrine</h1><br>

<h3>1.Project Description:</h3><br>
The project I have in mind is a DnD character generator. Individuals will be able to import and export their character's information, or access characters through their account. The website will also function as a character sheet, this sheet will have the same fields and functionality as the paper sheets. This means users will be able to keep track of various things such as money, health, inventory, skills, etc. The creator and the DM will both be able to edit these sheets.<br>
<h3>2.Project Design:</h3><br>
A. I will need to use Spring MVC and the Jackson library to create this website. The jackson library will be integrated into java classes allowing users to use JSON files and save information locally if the users chooses to do so. Along with this I will be using a database to store character information for accounts. To display the character's informaiton I will also be using Spring MVC along with a possible CSS if I can find one that fits the theme and functionality.<br>
<br>B.Use cases<br>
B1. Allow users to create a character that will be scalable to level and follow the algorithms in the character creation books<br>
B2. Allow users to import/export characters to JSON files to share or move from one device to another.<br>
B3. After character is created users will be able to use the website to keep track of and edit their character sheet (Health, inventory, stats, etc)<br>
B3.5. Users will be able to save the progress of their characters and all information will be retained.<br>
B4. Users will be able to access all of their characters made on their account regardless of the device they are using.<br>
B5. Allow the person in charge of the DnD campaing to view other user's characters and edit their page as well (give items, subtract health, etc).<br>
<h3>3.Project shedule:</h3><br>
Checkpoint1: Allow users to navigate through creation pages and allow users to create their own characters. Have backend calculations made so that all ability scores and ability modifiers are calculated. Display all character information to a page where users can edit health values.<br>
Checkpoint2: Allow users to save character to their account. Allow individuals link character to groups. Also allow users to reroll stats.<br>
Checkpoint3: Setup database and allow user to save characters to database. Allow users to query the database for characters based on a groups id. Also allow users to roll hit dice and subtract from the character's current HP.<br>
<h3>4.Project Justificaiton:</h3><br>
Novelty: There are some DnD character creation websites on the internet but as far as I've found none of them allow for exporting characters, tracking character details, or in depth creation that follows the guidelines in the books. Along with this I haven't found any that allow users to use the website instead of a handwritten character sheet. Users will save a great deal of time using this website because most of the character creation will be done for them. Along with this the website will offer an easy to use way of tracking character details throughout playing.<br>
Complexity: This project will be a good showcase of my ability by leveraging the things I have learned throughout this semester. Along with this I will be working on a lot of backend to make sure that the character creation follows the books. While it doesn't necessarily leverage what was learned in class, will take a lot of attention to detail to create the algorithms needed. Lastly, I will be using a database to let users access their characters, which will be a learning experience due to my lack of using databases in the past. I will also need to include a multiple user envrioment to allow for 2 users to access and edit the same page simultaneously.<br>
